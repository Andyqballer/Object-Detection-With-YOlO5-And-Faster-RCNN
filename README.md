# Object Detection with Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5
Overview
* This repository contains a Python script for performing real-time object detection using two popular deep learning models: Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5. The script is designed to run in Google Colab and leverages the COCO dataset for training and testing. It includes functionality for capturing images from a webcam and detecting objects in real-time.

** Features
Downloads and prepares the COCO dataset.
Trains a Faster R-CNN model for object detection.
Trains a YOLOv5 model for object detection.
Captures video frames from a webcam for real-time detection.
Displays detected objects on the video feed.
Requirements
To run this code, you will need:

Python 3.x
Google Colab
Internet access for downloading the COCO dataset and required packages.
Installation
Clone the repository (if applicable) or copy the code into a new notebook in Google Colab.
Install the necessary libraries. The script automatically installs required dependencies, including:
opencv-python-headless
pycocotools
torch
torchvision
yaml
Other dependencies as needed.
Usage
Run the script in Google Colab. The main function initializes the object detection trainer, downloads the COCO dataset, prepares the dataset for YOLO training, trains both models, and starts the webcam for real-time object detection.

main()

Webcam Access: Make sure your browser has permission to access the webcam. The video feed will be displayed, and detected objects will be outlined with bounding boxes.

Stopping the Detection: To stop the detection process, press q while the video feed window is active.

Functionality
Dataset Download: Downloads images and annotations from the COCO dataset.
Dataset Preparation: Prepares the dataset for training with both Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5.
Model Training: Trains the models using the downloaded dataset. Training parameters can be modified in the script.
Real-Time Object Detection: Captures video from the webcam and runs object detection using the trained models, displaying results in real-time.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors related to JavaScript execution, ensure that your browser supports the necessary features.
Make sure you have a stable internet connection for downloading the dataset.
If the models fail to train or load, check that all required libraries are installed properly.
